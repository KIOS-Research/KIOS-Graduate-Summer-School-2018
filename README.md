# KIOS-Graduate-Summer-School-2018
## Definitions
- `Python` is one of the most popular programming languages used extensively in web development, as well as in science and engineering (including data science). In this course we will use `Python 2.7`.
- `Jypyter` is a browser-based tool which allows us to interface with `Python` in an easy way. We can create `notebooks` which we can share so that others can replicate our work and make changes.
-`Anaconda` is an environment which makes it easy to setup various languages and tools, such as `Python`. 


## Instructions on how to install Anaconda and Python 2.7

1. Download `Python 2.7 version` from the Anaconda website (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). *Make sure you select the `2.7` version.* 
2. When prompted in instalation, select `Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable` 
3. When installation has finished, run `Anaconda Prompt`. This will open a command line window in Windows.
4. Run the command `jupyter notebook`. This should open a local jupyter notebook.
